Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). 
Also, it's good to have an editor to work with the code, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).



### üöß Running the BackEnd (server)

```bash
git init

git clone https://github.com/Gabrielingnau/ApiSolid

  NODE_ENV=dev
  JWT_SECRET=
  DATABASE_URL= ("It will be generated automatically when you run the Docker command: (docker compose up -d)")

# Install the necessary dependencies
$ npm install

# Now start the BackEnd server
$ npm run start:dev

# The server will start at port:3333 - go to <http://localhost:3333>
```
